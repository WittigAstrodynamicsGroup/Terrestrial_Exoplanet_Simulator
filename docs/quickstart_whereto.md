# Where to go from here
In addition to reading the [API section](api.md), you can learn most about REBOUND by looking at some of the [example problems](examples.md). 
The C examples are located in the `examples/` directory. 
The python and iPython examples are located in the `python_examples/` and `ipython_examples/` directories respectively. 

You might also want to have a look at the `rebound.h` file in the `src/` directory which contains the precise function prototypes and structure definitions.

If you run into a problem or can't find an answer in this documentation, [open an issue](https://github.com/hannorein/rebound/issues) on GitHub or e-mail one of the [contributors](/#contributors). 
We'll do our best to help you quickly.

# Welcome to REBOUND

![REBOUND Examples](docs/img/reboundbanner.png)

REBOUND is an N-body integrator, i.e. a software package that can integrate the motion of particles under the influence of gravity. The particles can represent stars, planets, moons, ring or dust particles. REBOUND is very flexible and can be customized to accurately and efficiently solve many problems in astrophysics.  
 
## Documentation
The full documentation with many examples, changelogs and tutorials can be found at

<https://rebound.readthedocs.org>

If you have trouble installing or using REBOUND, please open an issue on github and we'll try to help as much as we can.

There are also short YouTube videos describing various aspects of REBOUND available at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2wonKI0wWwGi5-JqJtMsYQ/videos.
